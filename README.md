# HospitalPlanner
Preface: _Planificarea pacientilor la cabinetele doctorilor dintr-un spital, pe baza preferintelor si programului acestora._

Hospital Planner is a web application designed to streamline appointment management in hospitals. It offers patients the ability to book appointments with doctors and view their schedules. In cases where a preferred appointment slot is unavailable, the system provides recommendations for alternative open slots based on the patient's preferences.

Furthermore, each appointment includes a report feature, allowing doctors to fill in treatment details and diagnoses. Patients can access their reports once they have been completed by the doctor, providing transparency and easy access to their medical information.

Healthcare professionals can manage their schedules, and administrators have access to a dashboard for administrative tasks. The application aims to enhance the patient experience, optimize resource utilization, and provide data-driven insights for decision-making.
